You were begging me to stay 'til the sun rose
I wish I didn't, but I do remember every moment of the nights with you
She's the kind of song you could play forever
I could be lonely with you
If the whole world was watching I'd still dance with you
Always holding your love supreme
But honey, I'm still on your side
Now I'm just a stranger that you know best
Yeah, I wanna find tomorrow with you, baby
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak
Take my hand, I don't need any fear
And I'll dream each night of some version of you that I might not have but I did not lose
You won't reply and we'll go back to strangers
Why then, if she's so perfect, do I still wish that it was you?
I'm only here passing time in her arms
Hoping to find a glimpse of us
Maybe you'll start slipping slowly and find me again
Are you happy now?
Maybe we can stay another minute?
Wrote the message, but I never pressed send
Did we buy these roses just for them to die?
I don't know how to be myself without you
You're losing more than what you're worth
Baby, I could write a long love letter
I will find anyway to your wild heart
I won't waste my time on this wicked feeling
Maybe you're already too broken to be who I need you to be
I'd be a fool not to love you
I just want you to know who I am
I've been waiting for someone you won't become
